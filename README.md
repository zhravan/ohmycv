### OhMyCV in latex

I created this CV in LaTeX after struggling with dissatisfying templates or difficulty maintaining a clean, consistent format across different platforms and documents.

I decided to separate my CV from the template itself. My actual CV (with all personal details) is maintained in a private repository, while this repository serves as the public template.

This way, I can safely manage my CV in private while also sharing a clean, reusable LaTeX template that others can fork and adapt for their resumes.

I personally use Overleaf for editing, which makes maintaining and sharing LaTeX documents much easier.
